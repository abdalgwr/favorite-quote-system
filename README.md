# Favorite Quotes Microservice

## Overview
This microservice provides a **ZeroMQ-based API** for managing favorite quotes. Users can:
- **Save a quote** to favorites.
- **Retrieve a list of favorite quotes**.
- **Remove a quote from favorites**.

This microservice communicates using **ZeroMQ REQ-REP pattern**, meaning each request **expects** a corresponding response.

## **Communication Contract**

### **How to REQUEST Data from the Microservice**
All communication is done using **ZeroMQ**. To send a request, create a ZeroMQ `REQ` socket and send one of the following commands.

```python
socket.send_string("get")  # Sends the <get> keyword to retrieve a saved quote
response = socket.recv_string()  # Receives the quote from the server
print(f"Retrieved quote: {response}")  # Expected response: A previously saved quote


#### **1. Save a Quote**
**Request format:**

quote = "This is a quote" #this can be any quote generated by your program
socket.send_string(f"save:{quote}") #the <save:> keyword tells the micro program to save the quote. So we send the keyword with the quote via socket.send_string
response = socket.recv_string() #receives the reponse from the server
print(response)  #expected response: "Quote successfully saved!"
