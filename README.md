# Favorite Quotes Microservice

## Overview
This microservice provides a **ZeroMQ-based API** for managing favorite quotes. Users can:
- **Save a quote** to favorites.
- **Retrieve a list of favorite quotes**.
- **Remove a quote from favorites**.

This microservice communicates using **ZeroMQ REQ-REP pattern**, meaning each request **expects** a corresponding response.

## **Communication Contract**

### **How to REQUEST Data from the Microservice**
All communication is done using **ZeroMQ**. To send a request, create a ZeroMQ `REQ` socket and send one of the following commands.

```python
    context = zmq.Context()
    socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)
    socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5555") #using port 5555
```

#### **1. Save a Quote**
**Request format: "save:{quote}"**
the <save:> keyword tells the microservice to save the quote. All you have to do is to include <save:> and your <quote> and send them via socket.send_string()
```python
quote = "This is a quote" #this can be any quote generated by your program
socket.send_string(f"save:{quote}") #the <save:> keyword tells the micro program to save the quote. So we send the keyword with the quote via socket.send_string
response = socket.recv_string() #receives the reponse from the server
print(response)  #expected response: "Quote successfully saved!"
```
